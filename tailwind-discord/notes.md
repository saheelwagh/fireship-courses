# tailwindc css
## should I use tailwind ?
better for beginners to get exposed to underlying css classes -> utlize the peek feature of vscode extentions

first learn box model 

and then grid and flexbox philosophy

work well with component based js frameworks or lib

dev who wants high customization faster ? -> then use tailwind
